# YeastMate model weights

By default, the YeastMate backend server will look for model weights named ```yeastmate_weights.pth``` in this directory.
You can download our pretrained weights from https://osf.io/2xr4m/?view_only=True

If you are just using the yeastmatedetector code, leaving the default OSF download link in the config file will make YeastMate automatically download and use those weights.
