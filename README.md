# YeastMate

This is the main repository for YeastMate. You can find the prepackaged installers under releases, and please leave any comments or issues on this repository.

Check out our detailed documentation at https://yeastmate.readthedocs.org, especially if you encounter any problems during installation or start-up, we've got some common problems covered :)

As Github downloads are quite slow, it's recommended to download the installers/releases from https://osf.io/287fr/

You can find the Fiji backend at https://github.com/hoerlteam/YeastMateFiji

and the code repositories of the frontend and IO backends (for the GUI version) at

https://github.com/hoerlteam/YeastMateFrontend

and
